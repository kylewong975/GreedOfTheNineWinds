# GreedOfTheNineWinds

A procedurally-generated roguelike adventure in which you must learn to control your greed!

### Synopsis of the Storyline:
Under the quaint little town of Gelais, there is a vast amount of treasures that are yet to be uncovered. This is because there are only very few brave souls yet to challenge the magical powers of Cupidras. The brave ones are unable to make it back, unfortunately, due to greed and poor critical choices. The breath of Cupidras roams around freely under the earth, trapping greedy miners into a sticky trap and strategically placing more valuable treasures deeper down the earth. The further you go down, the more side effects you will encounter. If you desperately want to go back to surface level, the air of Cupidras will bring you down. Greed destroys you, and once you make poor decisions, you will end up in a sticky situation that you may never escape, even at the cost of your life. Are you ready to explore the mines of Gelais?
